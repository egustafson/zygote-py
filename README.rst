Install locally using:

The above command deploys the project in "Development Mode" using the
develop_ verb.  The project is deployed into the user's home directory
with the '--user' flag.

.. _develop:
https://setuptools.pypa.io/latest/setuptools.html#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode

The files will be deployed into a tree under ``~/.local``.  Adding
``~/.local/bin`` to your path is sufficient to execute the local
copies, or run files from .local/bin using there full path.
